# AI CFO Agent - Autonomous CFO with Digital Twin for MSPs

## üöÄ SuperHack 2025 Submission - Team Lotus

### Problem Statement
MSPs face financial blindness and lack predictive insights, losing 1-5% of revenue annually ($10K-$50K for a $1M-revenue MSP) due to:
- Unprofitable clients and manual tracking errors
