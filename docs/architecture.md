- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify (for production)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time dashboard with financial insights
  - Interactive scenario simulation
  - Automated report generation
  - Mobile-responsive design

### Backend (FastAPI + AWS Bedrock)
- **Technology**: FastAPI, Python 3.9+, AWS Bedrock
- **Features**:
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - AWS Bedrock integration for AI reasoning
  - Mock SuperOps data integration
